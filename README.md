# ScDeepTools
The software includes three deep generative models, a pseudo-cell inference model, a noisy cell inference model, and an LDA-based inference model for cell classification and class-specific genes analysis. Moreover, the software includes an interactive single-cell sequencing cell distribution mapping tool for manipulation of cell deletion and export.
